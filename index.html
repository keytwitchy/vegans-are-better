    <h2>Why Vegan?</h2>
    <p>
      When I first decided to go vegan nearly 14 years ago after watching <a href="https://youtu.be/es6U00LMmC4?si=TU2lAUs1GWWRm-RU" target="_blank" class="video-link">Gary Yourofsky's legendary speech</a>, I was excited to share what I had learned with my friends and family. But instead of finding open-mindedness and understanding, I was met with fierce hostility and defensiveness. People made assumptions about my character, assuming I thought I was morally superior or was simply jumping on some trend. The truth, however, was far from that. I wasn’t trying to appear better than anyone. I just came to the realization that we’re complicit in choices that directly contradict our own moral values.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also started to really understand the gruesome reality behind the industry that provides meat, dairy, and eggs. The suffering that these animals endure is beyond comprehension. Chickens are packed into tiny cages, unable to move, their beaks are chopped off without anesthesia, and they're genetically manipulated to grow so quickly they often can't even walk. Pigs are confined to metal crates so small they can't turn around, their screams echoing in factory farms as they're subjected to painful mutilations like tail docking and teeth clipping, all without any form of pain relief. Cows, once taken from their mothers, are subjected to harsh conditions, their udders painfully swollen with milk that will be stolen away. And these are just the animals that make it to the slaughterhouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we talk about what happens there, it's not a simple process of "humanely" putting an animal out of its misery—it’s a brutal, violent system where animals are often shackled while still alive, their throats slit and bodies hoisted upside down as they bleed out. Many are still conscious when they are plunged into scalding water to remove their hair. All of this happens behind closed doors, hidden from the public eye, to shield us from the guilt we would feel if we truly understood what we were paying for when we buy meat.
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s the normalization of cruelty for the sake of convenience or taste that stings the most. We willingly ignore the violence that animals endure, all for a fleeting moment of flavor. This realization wasn’t about feeling morally superior, it was about the overwhelming recognition that no one, no matter how much they deny it, deserves to suffer like that just to satisfy our desires.
    </p>
    <p>
      And as much as I initially bristled at the accusations that I thought I was somehow ‘better’ than everyone, I came to realize that, in a way, they were right—but not in the way they thought. It wasn’t that I thought I was ‘better’ because I had chosen veganism. It was that I was simply choosing not to participate in the cruelty that defines our treatment of animals, and that made me, in that moment, better. Not morally superior in a grand, ego-driven sense, but in the sense that I was finally aligning my actions with my values, something that many people were too afraid to confront. The truth is, if we all made that shift, if we all chose empathy over apathy, we would all be better. We’d be better humans, better stewards of the planet, and we’d be better for the animals whose suffering we’ve all too often overlooked.
