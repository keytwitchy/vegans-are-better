  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>
    Hey there. I don’t collect your data for the sake of corporate surveillance or for some shady marketing scheme. You won’t find any hidden tracking cookies or personal information harvested for resale to the highest bidder here. What you send me through the contact form is only used to respond to you directly — that's it.
  </p>
  <p>
    When you submit a message, I get your name, email, and whatever message you’ve decided to share. I’ll use that info exclusively to respond to your inquiry. That’s the whole deal. Once I respond, your data isn’t stored longer than necessary. I’m not interested in keeping your personal info around any longer than it takes to have a meaningful conversation.
  </p>
  <p>
    As far as I’m concerned, your privacy matters — unlike the corporate data vampires that harvest your info without a second thought. I won’t share, sell, or otherwise misuse any of the information you’ve entrusted to me.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you have any questions about how I handle your data or need to make changes to what you’ve submitted, just get in touch.
  </p>
  <p>
    Keep your data to yourself — it’s yours. I’m just here to help.
